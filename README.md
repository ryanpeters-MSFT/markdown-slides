# Markdown Slides

A simple static app that renders Markdown files as slide decks.

## Usage

1. Open index.html in a browser.
2. Click "Choose Markdown file(s)" and select one or more .md files.
3. Use Left/Right arrow keys (or PageUp/PageDown) to navigate.
4. Press F or click the slide stage to toggle fullscreen.

## Slide format

- Use `---` on its own line to split slides inside a single file.
- If you select multiple files, each file (and any `---` separators inside it) becomes a slide.
- Any Markdown content is supported (headings, lists, code blocks, images).
